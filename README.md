# TO THE BEAT! PRIVACY POLICY

The following Privacy Policy clarifies what the official to the beat! ("ttb!") Discord bot ("Bot") stores in order to improve user experience.

<strong>“User Data”</strong> means any and all data Bot may obtain through the Discord APIs. That implies any information associated with any Discord user ("User") that has joined the <a href="https://discord.gg/YYtpYBr">official ttb! Discord server</a> ("Server"), including but not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>
        User ID;
    </li>
    <li>
        Username;
    </li>
    <li>
        Discriminator;
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>"Administration"</strong> (or <strong>"Administrators"</strong>) includes any User in Server with the "Administrator" role.

By using the Bot or joining our Server, you grant the ttb! staff team ("Staff Team") permission to store and utilize User Data if necessary to ensure that the Server complies with <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.

Any further questions regarding this Privacy Policy shall be directed to Administration.

## What User Data we collect
At the time of when a punishment was issued, Bot stores the following information ("Mod-log Information"):
<ul id="mod-log-information-list">
    <li>Name and discriminator of the punished user</li>
    <li>User ID of the punished user</li>
    <li>Reason for issued punishment</li>
    <li>Type of punishment</li>
    <li>User ID of the Staff Team member&nbsp;issuing the punishment<br></li>
    <li>Name and discriminator of the Staff Team member issuing the punishment</li>
    <li>Date and time of when the punishment is issued (ISO 8601 format)</li>
</ul>

## How we store your User Data
User Data is stored securely in a MongoDB database on a secure Virtual Private Server ("VPS"). Encryption and safety of all User Data and Mod-log Information is ensured.

## Why we collect User Data
In order to conveniently keep track of moderator actions, Staff Team members are permitted to view Mod-log Information without giving prior notice to Administration. This allows Staff Team to indisputably assist Users with punishment appeals and ensure compliance of the Server with Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

## When we collect User Data
User Data is collected for indefinite period of time when a Staff Team member issues a punishment to a User.

## How to remove your User Data
Unfortunately, we are unable to remove your user ID for security purposes under any circumstances. However, it is possible to have your username hidden or deleted in Mod-log Information per manual request done by sending an e-mail to shivaco.osu@gmail.com.
